Lalu Prasad Yadav hints at new alliance with Paras ahead of Bihar Assembly polls,"Patna, Jan 15 (IANS) Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) national president Lalu Prasad Yadav added a political flavour to the traditional Dahi-Chura feast organised by former Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras on Wednesday. 

Lalu Prasad, a prominent political figure in Bihar, attended the event along with his elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav, making it a notable moment in the state’s political calendar.

On the occasion of the traditional Dahi-Chura feast, a new political equation appears to be emerging, with RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav hinting at a significant development involving Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras.

Speaking to the media at the feast hosted by Paras, Lalu Prasad said, “Paras is with us,” sparking speculation of a potential political alliance. Lalu Prasad’s presence at the feast holds significance in light of the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, expected later this year.

The event, traditionally seen as a symbol of harmony and camaraderie, has often been used as an opportunity for political leaders to send subtle signals and engage in behind-the-scenes discussions.

Pashupati Kumar Paras, a key leader and the younger brother of the late Ram Vilas Paswan, represents the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP). The participation of Lalu Prasad Yadav, despite his health concerns, adds weight to the event, potentially signalling efforts to forge broader political strategies or alliances in preparation for the electoral battle ahead. As the Assembly elections approach, such developments will likely play a critical role in shaping the political landscape of Bihar.

The festival of Makar Sankranti In Bihar is often a stage for political realignments, and this year seems no different. The statement of Lalu Prasad Yadav comes at a time when Paras’ party, the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP), has been side-lined in the NDA. This marginalisation began after Chirag Paswan’s faction of the LJP gained prominence within the NDA ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, leaving Paras’s RLJP without any seats or significant role in the alliance.

Frustrated by the lack of recognition, Paras had distanced himself from the NDA and started exploring new political opportunities.","Patna, Jan 15 (IANS) Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) national president Lalu Prasad Yadav added a political flavour to the traditional Dahi-Chura feast organised by former Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras&#8230; Continue reading Lalu Prasad Yadav hints at new alliance with Paras ahead of Bihar Assembly polls

"Tejashwi gets power at par with Lalu Prasad in RJD, to take key decisions of party","Patna, Jan 18 (IANS) The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is undergoing a significant leadership transition, with its founder and longtime president Lalu Prasad Yadav formally preparing to hand over the reins to his son, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav. 

During a crucial meeting of the RJD National Executive, both Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav were granted full authority over all major decisions related to the party, including its name and election symbol.

The party constitution was amended to enable Tejashwi to share equal decision-making authority with Lalu Prasad Yadav, ensuring a smooth leadership transition.

RJD leader Ramchandra Purve has been appointed as the election officer to oversee organisational elections. The election of the National President will take place on July 5, which is expected to formalise Tejashwi Yadav’s appointment to the position.

Elections for the state president and other organisational roles will follow, with a meeting of the state executive scheduled for June 21 to discuss the selection of Bihar’s new state president.

“The decision to conduct organisational elections is aimed at enhancing participation from party workers and encouraging young leadership within the RJD,” Jha said. This is seen as a step to modernise the party while remaining rooted in its core values. This transition signifies the end of an era where Lalu Prasad Yadav dominated the political narrative of the RJD since its inception.

With Tejashwi Yadav leading the charge, the party aims to consolidate its position and prepare for upcoming electoral battles in Bihar and at the national level.

“People couldn’t roam freely during Lalu Prasad’s tenure as CM”: Bihar Minister Renu Devi,"Bihar Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Renu Devi has lashed out at Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, saying that people used to lock their houses and couldn’t roam freely when Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Chief Minister. Devi’s reaction comes after Tejashwi Yadav made remarks against her over the kidnapping charges levelled against her brother Pinu. Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, played a CCTV clip, where the minister’s brother can be seen occupying the land at gunpoint. Reacting to this, Devi said that she has nothing to do with her brother since they remain estranged. “I have nothing to do with my brother, Tejashwi Yadav has taken my name, eight years ago, I said in press conferences several times that I do not have a brother. Secondly, the opposition does not have any issue. During his father’s rule, people could not roam openly, houses were locked in the evening. Tejashwi Yadav had asked what MPs and MLAs do here, they do not have even four people to give them a shoulder. The four people who were there in the last election were also with us. Before talking about others, they should look into their own affairs,” the minister said. Earlier, Tejashwi Yadav had said that the minister’s brother has become a criminal and his work has become to continuously occupy land by threatening.He further said that RJD workers were arrested but there was inaction against those with criminal “image”. Yadav added that this was not the first time this incident has happened. “Dozens of criminal cases are registered against Minister Renu Devi’s brother, despite this, this person is roaming freely,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal accused RJD over the law and order condition in the state, saying that 90 per cent of the criminals are leaders belonging to Tejashwi Yadav’s party. He said that there was good governance in Bihar and no criminal would be spared.“As far as law and order is concerned, 90 per cent of the criminals are RJD leaders. They will be the ones to be arrested. There is good governance in Bihar and no criminal will be spared. But when will you get punished for the crimes committed by your entire family? If you can’t do anything, then at least return land of the poor man of Gopalganj who used to milk the cow in your house,” Jaiswal said.",The News Mill
